- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think that inheritence is a clearly powerful tool. It ut down on coding time, similar to the effect or loops in that they allow you to replicate similar code again and again and add your own edits and adjustments as well. I found this assignment very straightforward and I enjoyed being able to see my code all run very smoothly, and I was able to iron out any bumps along the way fairly quickly. I would advise to always get started on assignments earlier than you think you should, because I got pretty swamped with work this week and had to take a one day extension to ensure I am turning in my best complete work now.
